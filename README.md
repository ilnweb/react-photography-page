<h1>React - photography-page </h1>

This is a personal project in which I created a simple photography page using Create-react-app.

<h4>In this project I use:</h4>
<ul>

<li>react-full-page - For the front page slider</li>
<li>react-waypoint - to trigger an even when an element is in view</li>
<li>Cloudinary API - I hosted the images in Cloudinary and dymicaly call them by tag using only one component.</li>
<li>EmailJS API - I integrated EmailJs and used the mailing servive from my domaein so I can send emails when a form is submited. </li>

</ul>
