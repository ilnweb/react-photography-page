React - photography-page 

This is a personal project in which I created a simple photography page using Create-react-app.

In this project I use:

react-full-page - For the front page slider
react-waypoint - to trigger an even when an element is in view
Cloudinary API - I hosted the images in Cloudinary and dymicaly call them by tag using only one component.
EmailJS API - I integrated EmailJs and used the mailing servive from my domaein so I can send emails when a form is submited.
